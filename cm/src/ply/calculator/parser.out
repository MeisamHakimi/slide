Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> S
Rule 1     S -> E
Rule 2     E -> E PLUS NUMBER
Rule 3     E -> NUMBER

Terminals, with rules where they appear

NUMBER               : 2 3
PLUS                 : 2
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

E                    : 1 2
S                    : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . S
    (1) S -> . E
    (2) E -> . E PLUS NUMBER
    (3) E -> . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 3

    S                              shift and go to state 1
    E                              shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (0) S' -> S .



state 2

    (1) S -> E .
    (2) E -> E . PLUS NUMBER

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (S -> E .)
    PLUS            shift and go to state 4


state 3

    (3) E -> NUMBER .

    PLUS            reduce using rule 3 (E -> NUMBER .)
    $end            reduce using rule 3 (E -> NUMBER .)


state 4

    (2) E -> E PLUS . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 5


state 5

    (2) E -> E PLUS NUMBER .

    PLUS            reduce using rule 2 (E -> E PLUS NUMBER .)
    $end            reduce using rule 2 (E -> E PLUS NUMBER .)
